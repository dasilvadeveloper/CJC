// My name will never change, ergo, I used a const variable to assign the string value because it was most appropriate.
const myName = 'Felipe Angelucci';
// My favorite city will also never change because it holds a special place in my heart.
// myFavoriteCity
const myFavoriteCity = 'Rome';
// The statement below utiizes back ticks (``) to use a template literal by interpolating the variables into readable strings. Template literals also are very efficient since they can be read and understood easily.
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. My favorite city is ${myFavoriteCity}`)
