/*
This is project 1 of 2 projects I'll build on my own for the conditionals section of this free online course.
The idea behind this project: Employees at companies need help figuring out whether or not they should seek therapy. They don't want to do a long boring survey so the survey will be concise and helpful.
This mental health survey will ask questions about their sleep habits, work habits, relationships with family and friends, and other factors that may improve mental health or worsen it.
Conditional statements will be used to log answers as true or false and if statements will be utilized to deliver a result of whether or not the employee should seek therapy to improve their mental health.

// This project will be done once I finish the lesson on conditionals to gain the skills first before testing them with a project.
